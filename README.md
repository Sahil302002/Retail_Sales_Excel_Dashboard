## **Recommendations**:

- **Improve Customer Satisfaction**:
    - Focus on reducing the percentage of "Low" satisfaction customers (**40%**). Analyze reasons (e.g., late shipping, quality issues) and implement corrective actions like faster delivery or better communication.
- **Cost Optimization**:
    - Review shipping costs. DHL and FedEx constitute over 50% of the shipping expenditure. Negotiate contracts or explore alternate logistics solutions to lower costs.
- **Expand Profitable Locations**:
    - Invest in underperforming regions like Missouri and Arizona to increase market share and revenue.
- **Seasonal Promotions**:
    - Leverage high-performing months (May, June, and September) for targeted campaigns. Use insights from February’s dip to create strategies for sales recovery.
- **Agent Shift Adjustments**:
    - Consider increasing morning shifts in high-demand regions, as they yield slightly better revenue.
- **Diversify Product Offerings**:
    - Explore shoe size demands beyond 38–41 to cater to untapped market segments, ensuring inclusive product availability.
